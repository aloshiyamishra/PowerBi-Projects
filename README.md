# Road Accident Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview

The **Road Accident Analysis Dashboard** is a Power BI project developed to analyze historical road accident data and uncover patterns related to accident severity, casualties, road conditions, vehicle types, and time trends. The dashboard transforms complex raw data into interactive visual insights that support data-driven road safety decisions.

---

## Objective

To analyze road accident data and identify key patterns related to casualties, accident severity, road conditions, vehicle types, and temporal trends in order to support road safety improvements.

---

## Problem Statement

Road accidents result in significant loss of life and property every year. Understanding **when, where, and why accidents occur** is critical for implementing effective safety measures. However, raw accident data is large and complex, making analysis difficult without proper visualization and analytical tools.

## Data Description

### Data Source

* Government road accident dataset / public road safety dataset
* File format: CSV / Excel

### Data Volume

* Tens of thousands of records representing individual accident cases

### Data Fields

* Accident Date
* Accident Severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight)
* Number of Casualties
* Vehicle Type
* Road Type
* Road Surface Condition
* Weather Condition
* Light Condition
* Urban / Rural Area
* Location (City / Region)

### Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Removed duplicate records
* Handled missing and null values
* Standardized categorical values (road types, vehicle types, conditions)
* Converted date fields into proper date format
* Created calculated columns and measures using DAX

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Power BI Desktop** – Dashboard development and visualization
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – KPIs and calculated measures
* **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation
* **Excel / CSV** – Data source
* **Data Modeling** – Relationships between fact and dimension tables

---

## Target Audience

* Traffic Police Departments
* Government & Transport Authorities
* Road Safety Analysts
* Urban Planners
* Data Analysts & Power BI Learners

---

## Key Dashboard Features

* Interactive filters and slicers (date, location, severity, vehicle type)
* KPIs showing:

  * Total Accidents
  * Total Casualties
  * Fatal, Serious, and Slight Casualties
* Trend analysis by year and month
* Breakdown by road type, weather, light condition, and vehicle type
* Drill-down analysis for location-based insights

---

## Key Insights

* Majority of casualties occur on **single carriageways**
* **Urban areas** account for the highest share of accidents
* Daytime accidents are more frequent, but **low-light conditions show higher severity**
* Cars and bikes contribute to the largest number of casualties
* Accident hotspots are concentrated around major cities

---

## Project Scope & Limitations

### Scope

* Analyze historical accident data
* Identify accident-prone locations and conditions
* Provide insights to support road safety planning

### Limitations

* Dataset is historical (no real-time data)
* Accuracy depends on the quality of government-provided data
* No predictive modeling or forecasting included

---

## Outcome

* Improved understanding of accident patterns and severity
* Identification of high-risk locations and conditions
* Faster and clearer reporting compared to raw datasets
* Actionable insights to support road safety initiatives

---

## Future Enhancements

* Integration of real-time accident data
* Inclusion of driver demographics (age, gender)
* Predict accident-prone zones using machine learning models
* Incorporate traffic volume and speed data
* Automated alerts for high-risk conditions
